# Data Warehousing Project
This repository contains the source code for a data warehousing project developed for a client. The project is designed to store, process, and analyze transactional data related to sales of products. The repository contains code for both data processing and querying.

## Architecture
The project is built using a cloud-based architecture. The data is stored in a Delta Lake format in an Amazon S3 bucket, which provides durability and scalability. The data processing is done using Apache Spark, which is a distributed computing framework designed for big data processing. The code is written in Python, and the Spark code is executed using PySpark. The processed data is stored in a separate Delta Lake table in the same S3 bucket.

## Data Processing
The data processing code is divided into two parts: data transformation and data aggregation. The data transformation code takes the raw transactional data as input, performs data cleaning and feature engineering, and produces a modified dataset with additional columns. The data aggregation code takes the modified dataset as input, groups the data by various dimensions, and computes aggregate statistics such as total sales and month-over-month growth.

## Querying
The querying code is designed to generate reports on the aggregated data. The code reads the processed data from the Delta Lake table and produces a report that shows the total sales and month-over-month growth for each product by year and month.

## Setup
To run the code in this repository, you will need an AWS account and an S3 bucket. You will also need to set up a Spark cluster, either locally or on a cloud-based platform such as Databricks.

## Usage
To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Modify the configuration files to point to your S3 bucket and Spark cluster.
3. Run the data processing code to transform and aggregate the data.
4. Run the querying code to generate reports on the aggregated data.

## Conclusion
This data warehousing project provides a scalable and efficient solution for storing, processing, and analyzing transactional data. The cloud-based architecture and use of distributed computing frameworks make it easy to handle large volumes of data, while the use of Delta Lake tables provides durability and consistency. The code in this repository can be easily modified and extended to suit the specific needs of any organization.
